# Multi-layer-AHB-lite
# AHB-Lite Based SoC Design

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the incremental development of an AMBA AHB-Lite based system-on-chip (SoC), starting from a **single-layer AHB-Lite system**, extending to a **multi-layer AHB-Lite interconnect**, and finally integrating a **RISC-V pipelined processor** as the host (master) in the multi-layer system.

The design connects to three memory-mapped peripherals (slaves):
- **Timer**
- **GPIO**
- **Register File**

---

## 🚀 Design Flow

### 1. Single-Layer AHB-Lite System
- Architecture includes **one master** and **multiple slaves**.
- Master initiates read/write transactions.
- Address decoding logic routes transactions to:
  - Timer
  - GPIO
  - Register File

---

### 2. Multi-Layer AHB-Lite System
- Extended to support **multiple masters** with parallelism.
- Key components of the interconnect:
  - **Arbiter** – resolves conflicts between masters.
  - **Slave Interface** – manages communication with slaves.
  - **Multiplexer** – routes master-to-slave signals.
- Each slave instantiates its own set of interconnect blocks.
- Supports **parallel transactions** when masters access different slaves.

---

### 3. RISC-V Integration
- A **RISC-V pipelined processor** is integrated as **Host A (Master A)**.
- A **testbench acts as Host B (Master B)**.
- Both masters connect to the multi-layer AHB-Lite interconnect.
- The RISC-V processor is customized to be compatible with the SoC:
  - Data memory is extended for memory-mapped peripherals.
  - Address mapping:
    - `0x0000 – 0x001F` → GPIO
    - `0x0020 – 0x003F` → Timer
    - `0x0040 and above` → Register File
   
### Work Idea:
- The **RISC APB Wrapper** takes the instruction from the **RISC-V processor** and checks if it is a load word (lw) or store word (sw) instruction with an offset greater than 1000. If so, it stops the processor by freezing the PC counter and routes the instruction through one of the peripherals (e.g., UART).
- The **RISC APB Wrapper** then translates the RISC-V instructions into specific instructions that can be understood by the standard **APB Master bus**.
- The **APB bus** generates the APB signals according to the input signals from the **RISC APB Wrapper** and sends these signals to the **APB Decoder**.
- The **APB Decoder** selects the appropriate peripheral based on the instruction's address offset:
  - If the offset is greater than 1000 and less than 2000, it chooses **Peripheral 1 (UART)**.
  - If the offset is greater than 2000 and less than 3000, it chooses **Peripheral 2**.
  - If the offset is greater than 3000 and less than 4000, it chooses **Peripheral 3**.
- The **APB Decoder** also converts the APB signals to peripheral-specific signals and converts the peripheral signals (e.g., **Ready** signal) back to APB signals to be sent to the APB Master.

In this section, we verify the functionality of the SoC design by simulating various test scenarios that showcase the interaction between the RISC-V processor, APB peripherals, and UART. The scenarios include testing data transmission, error handling, and performance under different conditions.

### First Scenario

- The first 6 instructions are to verify RISC-V Processor, from the 7th instruction we will start to verify our SoC:
![instruction](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/RISC_Instr.png)

- Now we carrying out the instruction: sw x4, 1200(x9) , so we will store x4 value (0Xf) in Tx FIFO in UART Peripheral, notice that the instruction is freezed due to our stop signal which stops the PC counter while using one of the peripherals:
![1st_1](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing%2F1st_1.png)

- After a certain time due to our baud rate, Tx FIFO now has the value 0xF
![1st_2](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing%2F1st_2.png)

- At this time the Data Memory at address (1204/4 = 301) has nothing written into
![1st_3](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/1st_3.png)


### Second Scenario

- Immediately after that the instruction is changed to be: sw x6, 1010(x9), instruction to store the value (0x9) in Tx FIFO, this shows our smooth implementation as the instructions are carried out one after another without a delay
![2nd_1](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/2nd_1.png)

- At the next baud clock positive edge the Tx FIFO now has the two values 
![2nd_2](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/2nd_2.png)

- At this time the address (1014/4 = 253) in Data Memory is empty 
![2nd_3](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/3rd_1.png)

### Third Scenario

- Now the instruction is changing to be: lw x1, 1200(x9), we will first wait the data to be serialized from Tx FIFO to Rx FIFO, then it will be out from data_out signal
![3rd_1](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/3rd_1.png)

- After a long time of serializing data, now the Rx FIFO has the value 0xF
![3rd_2](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/3rd_2.png)

- data is now out from the SoC
![3rd_3](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/3rd_3.png)


### Fourth Scenario

- instruction is changining again to carry out the last instruction in our scenario (lw x7, 1010(x9)) 
![4th_1](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/4th_1.png)

- Rx FIFO has the new value and it’s shown on data_out signal from the SoC
![4th_2](https://github.com/MohamedHussein27/SoC-Design-Connecting-RISC-V-Processor-with-Multiple-peripherals-using-APB-Bus/blob/main/Structure%20and%20Testing/4th_2.png)


### Full Wave:

## Explanation & Speed
All design files have detailed comments within them, so if anyone gets confused about a specific part, they can refer to the design file for clarity.

Additionally, to streamline the testing process, I created a **do file** for the **Tx FIFO** and another for the **Rx FIFO**, enabling faster execution and simulation.
